## Meet Me in the Middle Project

The **"Meet Me in the Middle"** project is designed to market a cocktail recipe along with the story behind its creation. The project includes a logo and a QR code that leads to an online PDF preview of the recipe and story.

This is a simple HTML website that redirects users to Canva for viewing the PDF online, due to issues with Google Drive, iframes and the inability of mobile browsers natively preview PDF files properly or without downloading.
